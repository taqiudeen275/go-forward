# OTP Verification Guide

## âœ… Issue Fixed!

The OTP services are now properly configured and working. You should receive actual emails and SMS messages instead of console logs.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your OTP Setup

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
./main.exe
```

You should see these logs confirming the services are configured:
```
[INFO] Email service configured for OTP delivery
[INFO] SMS service configured for OTP delivery
```

### 2. Test Email OTP

**Send Email OTP:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/otp/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "email",
    "recipient": "atarqiudeen@gmail.com",
    "purpose": "login"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:** You should receive an email with a 6-digit OTP code.

### 3. Test SMS OTP

**Send SMS OTP:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/otp/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "sms",
    "recipient": "233542851792",
    "purpose": "login"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:** You should receive an SMS with a 6-digit OTP code.

### 4. Verify OTP Code

Once you receive the OTP code, verify it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/otp/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "email",
    "recipient": "atarqiudeen@gmail.com",
    "code": "123456"
  }'
```

### 5. Login with OTP

For passwordless login:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/otp/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "sms",
    "recipient": "233542851792",
    "code": "654321"
  }'
```

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### The Problem
The server was creating the auth service but not configuring the email and SMS providers, so OTPs were only logged to console.

### The Solution
Updated `internal/server/server.go` to:

1. **Use `NewServiceWithConfig`** instead of basic `NewService`
2. **Configure Email Service** when SMTP settings are present
3. **Configure SMS Service** when Arkesel settings are present
4. **Add proper logging** to confirm services are configured

### Code Changes
```go
// Before (only console logging)
authService := auth.NewService(db)

// After (actual email/SMS delivery)
authService := auth.NewServiceWithConfig(db, cfg.Auth.JWTSecret, cfg.Auth.JWTExpiration, cfg.Auth.RefreshExpiration)

// Configure email service
if cfg.Auth.SMTP.Host != "" {
    smtpProvider := email.NewSMTPProvider(smtpConfig)
    emailService := email.NewService(smtpProvider, "Go Forward")
    authService.SetEmailService(emailService)
}

// Configure SMS service  
if cfg.Auth.SMS.Arkesel.ApiKey != "" {
    arkeselProvider := sms.NewArkeselProvider(cfg.Auth.SMS.Arkesel.ApiKey, cfg.Auth.SMS.Arkesel.Sender)
    smsService := sms.NewService(arkeselProvider, "Go Forward")
    authService.SetSMSService(smsService)
}
```
