# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Go Forward is a comprehensive backend framework designed as an internal tool for personal projects, built with Go and featuring a Next.js admin dashboard. The framework provides authentication, database management with real-time capabilities, API services, admin dashboard, and storage solutions.
