# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Go Forward is a comprehensive backend framework designed as an internal tool for personal projects, built with Go and featuring a SvelteKit admin dashboard. The framework provides authentication, database management with real-time capabilities, API services, admin dashboard, and storage solutions. It follows Supabase's architecture patterns while maintaining the flexibility of PocketBase for custom authentication models. The admin dashboard is embedded in the final build for seamless deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Method Authentication System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a flexible authentication system that supports multiple methods (OTP via email/phone, traditional credentials, and custom auth models), so that I can implement various authentication strategies for different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests OTP authentication THEN the system SHALL send a one-time password via email
2. WHEN a user requests OTP authentication THEN the system SHALL send a one-time password via SMS to phone number
3. WHEN a user provides email/username/phone number and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate using traditional credentials
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL issue a JWT token
5. WHEN a developer creates a custom auth model THEN the system SHALL support custom authentication logic similar to PocketBase
6. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
7. WHEN a JWT token is provided THEN the system SHALL validate and authorize requests

### Requirement 2: PostgreSQL Database with Real-time Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities and security features, so that I can build applications with live data updates and proper access control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework initializes THEN the system SHALL connect to a PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast real-time updates to subscribed clients
3. WHEN RLS policies are defined THEN the system SHALL enforce row-level security
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL respect security policies
5. WHEN real-time subscriptions are created THEN the system SHALL manage WebSocket connections efficiently

### Requirement 3: Database Management Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want both a SQL editor and visual interface for database management, so that I can create and modify database structures using my preferred method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide a SQL editor interface
2. WHEN using the SQL editor THEN the system SHALL execute SQL commands against the database
3. WHEN using the visual interface THEN the system SHALL allow creating tables through forms
4. WHEN using the visual interface THEN the system SHALL allow modifying table structures
5. WHEN migrations are created THEN the system SHALL support both CLI and interface-based migration management
6. WHEN SQL is executed THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and error feedback

### Requirement 4: RESTful API Services

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatically generated RESTful APIs for my database tables, so that I can quickly build client applications without manually creating endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a table is created THEN the system SHALL automatically generate CRUD endpoints
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate authentication and authorization
3. WHEN API responses are sent THEN the system SHALL return data in JSON format
4. WHEN filtering is requested THEN the system SHALL support query parameters for data filtering
5. WHEN pagination is needed THEN the system SHALL support limit and offset parameters
6. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return 401/403 status codes

### Requirement 5: Admin Dashboard Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive admin dashboard built with SvelteKit that's embedded in the final build, so that I can manage my backend services through a modern, mobile-responsive web interface with appealing design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display authentication status
2. WHEN managing tables THEN the system SHALL provide a visual table editor
3. WHEN viewing data THEN the system SHALL display table contents in a grid format
4. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL provide user administration tools
5. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL provide framework configuration options
6. WHEN monitoring activity THEN the system SHALL display system logs and metrics
7. WHEN using the dashboard on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a fully responsive interface
8. WHEN switching themes THEN the system SHALL support light and dark mode themes
9. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide an appealing design inspired by PocketBase and Supabase dashboards
10. WHEN the framework is built THEN the system SHALL embed the dashboard in the final binary for seamless deployment

### Requirement 6: File Storage System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a file storage system with proper access controls, so that I can handle file uploads and downloads securely in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them securely
2. WHEN file access is requested THEN the system SHALL validate permissions
3. WHEN files are served THEN the system SHALL support proper MIME types
4. WHEN storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN files are deleted THEN the system SHALL remove them from storage
6. IF unauthorized file access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access

### Requirement 7: Migration Management System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible migration management through both CLI and web interface, so that I can manage database schema changes efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrations are created via CLI THEN the system SHALL generate migration files
2. WHEN migrations are created via interface THEN the system SHALL generate equivalent migration files
3. WHEN migrations are applied THEN the system SHALL track migration history
4. WHEN migrations are rolled back THEN the system SHALL revert schema changes
5. WHEN migration conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
6. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL maintain database integrity

### Requirement 8: HTTP-Only Cookie Authentication Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable HTTP-only cookie authentication support, so that I can use secure cookie-based authentication for admin dashboard and other web applications that require enhanced security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP-only cookie mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL store JWT tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL set secure, HTTP-only cookies with proper SameSite attributes
3. WHEN requests are made with cookie authentication THEN the system SHALL validate tokens from cookies
4. WHEN logout is requested THEN the system SHALL clear authentication cookies properly
5. WHEN cookie authentication is configured THEN the system SHALL support both cookie and bearer token authentication simultaneously
6. WHEN CSRF protection is enabled THEN the system SHALL implement CSRF token validation for cookie-based requests
7. IF cookie authentication is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to bearer token authentication only

### Requirement 9: Framework Configuration and Extensibility
