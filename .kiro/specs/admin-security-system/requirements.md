# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Admin Hierarchy & Security System is a comprehensive security enhancement for the Go Forward framework that implements a multi-tiered administrative system with role-based access control (RBAC), enhanced authentication mechanisms, and robust security policies. This system addresses critical security gaps in the current implementation while maintaining the framework's flexibility as both a hosted Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) and a customizable starter framework.

The system introduces a hierarchical admin structure similar to enterprise-grade platforms, with System Admins having full framework control, Super Admins managing business operations, Regular Admins handling specific domains, and Moderators performing content oversight. This approach ensures proper separation of concerns and follows the principle of least privilege.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hierarchical Admin Role System

**User Story:** As a framework deployer, I want a hierarchical admin system with clearly defined roles and capabilities, so that I can delegate administrative responsibilities while maintaining security boundaries and operational control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a System Admin is created THEN they SHALL have unrestricted access to all framework features including SQL execution, system configuration, and admin management
3. WHEN a Super Admin is created THEN they SHALL have business-level administrative capabilities but SHALL NOT access system-level features like raw SQL execution
4. WHEN a Regular Admin is created THEN they SHALL have limited administrative access to assigned tables and user management within their domain
5. WHEN a Moderator is created THEN they SHALL have read-only access with specific content moderation capabilities
6. WHEN admin capabilities are checked THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based restrictions at both API and database levels
7. IF a lower-level admin attempts to access higher-level features THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 2: CLI-Based System Admin Management
